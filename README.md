## Stack

- ðŸ”’ TypeScript
- ðŸŽ‰ TailwindCSS for styling
- ðŸ“– [React Router v7](https://reactrouter.com/)
- ðŸ“– [Biome](https://biomejs.dev/) for linting and formatting
- ðŸ“– [Kamal](https://kamal-deploy.org/) for deployment
- [MapLibre](https://visgl.github.io/react-map-gl) and [OpenFreeMap](https://openfreemap.org) for the map, [zippopotam](https://api.zippopotam.us) for zip to lat and long
- [IndexedDB](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API) to store the saved houses.
- [GSAP](https://gsap.com/) for animations.

## Features

- Infinite loading of house listings
- Save houses to your own custom list using indexedDB
- Look at the saved houses on a map
- per page pagination
- Dark and light mode support
- server side rendering and client side fetching of data.
- retry logic for failed requests using [exponential backoff](https://medium.com/bobble-engineering/how-does-exponential-backoff-work-90ef02401c65)

## Decisions

### Architecture
- **React Router v7**: I really enjoy the architecture better than NextJS.
- **TypeScript**: Pretty much a standard, type safety is great and react-router has a typegen command for typed routes.
- **IndexedDB**: Initially was going with session storage but quickly ran out of space on the cookie, so storing on the client was better.
- **Server-Side Rendering**: Faster initial load.

### State Management
- **Client-Side State**: React's built in state together with react router's fetchers and loaders.

### Extra
- **Infinite Scroll**: Implemented with intersection observer for efficient events on the dom.

## Getting Started

![development](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1f829490-f2aa-4964-ab3b-825cc8313f27)

### Installation

Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### Development

Start the development server with HMR:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Your application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

### Linting and Formatting

```bash
npm run lint        # Run Biome linter
npm run lint:fix    # Fix linting issues
npm run format      # Format code
```

## Building for Production

Create a production build:

```bash
npm run build
```

## Deployment

The application is deployed to [Kamal](https://kamal-deploy.org/) to a VPS on Hetzner using the following command:

```bash
kamal deploy
```

To deploy the app there are two kamal secrets that need to be set:

- `KAMAL_REGISTRY_PASSWORD` - the password for the docker registry

These can be shared through a 1Password vault with the team,

The application is available at https://home-vision.woodpecker.rocks/

### Why Kamal?

Kamal is an open source tool great for small projects, it's easy to set up, fast to deploy and uses the already existing Dockerfile from the react-router template, it also provides SSL via Let's Encrypt.

## AI Integration

### Models Used in Cursor

- Claude 3.7 Sonnet
- GPT-4 Turbo

### Some of the prompts used

- "i want a nice hero section that will say some corny SaaS B2C phrase for finding your ideal home, it will have a CTA that will say something catchy, when clicking on it it will scroll the user down to the house listing. the hero will be just above the fold so users do see the range slider and the first couple of house listings"
- "when i run the save house card fetcher, it stores the house on the cookie session, the issue is that it has a limit to the amount of data it can store, let's use indexed DB to store the houses data on the browser"
- "the fetcher can fail, i want to retry if it fails, up to three times with exponential backoff"
- "let's customize the colors to be reused across the app, like background and foreground colors, blues and reds"
